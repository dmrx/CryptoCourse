<p>These are my notes of the sixth lecture from Coursera&#8217;s Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies during Dec 2016 &#8211; Feb 2017. This lecture seemed more like a teaser to the follow up lectures in that much of what was discussed was evaluating the phrase &#8221; Bitcoin coin is decentralized&#8221;. What parts of bitcoin are actually decentralized and where are the limitations?</p>
<p>Questions answered in this Post:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Where does decentralization currently?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Why is centralization vs. decentralization more a spectrum as opposed to an &#8220;all of nothing&#8221;?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">When you think &#8220;bitcoin decentralized?&#8221;, what components support this thought and what go against this notion?</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the last lecture made clear why centralization did not work for bitcoin. Do we really trust Scrooge? NO! His name is Scrooge&#8230;</p>
<p>Arvind goes into how bitcoin works with this decentralization. Decentralization is not all-or-nothing. Email is a decentralized protocol (SMTP) but has been dominated by centralized webmail services. Some examples would be like google/hotmail/yahoo.</p>
<h4>Questions regarding the decentralization in Bitcoin?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Who maintains the ledger?</li>
<li>Who has authority over which transactions are valid?</li>
<li>Who creates new bitcoins?</li>
<li>Who determines how the rules of the system change?</li>
<li>How do bitcoins acquire exchange value?</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ll put in what my answers were prior to the lectures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some majority of people on the network. When I say network, I guess there is a group of people (IP addresses/public keys) online who have copies of the ledger that they are constantly pinging out.</li>
<li>This majority. Perhaps several people have to say yes this transaction is valid. Since these people are perhaps trusted in other networks then they can check the transactions.</li>
<li>Miners create bitcoins. I&#8217;m not sure who they are or what they are doing besides running massive computations solving math puzzles.</li>
<li>Same answer as number 1.</li>
<li>Similar to any other traded security product.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Aspects of decentralization in Bitcoin</h4>
<ul>
<li>Peer-to-peer network: open to anyone, low barrier to entry</li>
<li>Bitcoin Mining: open to anyone, but inevitable concentration of power in the Bitcoin mining community</li>
<li>Updates to the software: core developer trusted by the community have great power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin has a peer to peer network meaning that anyone can log on to start up a full node. Thus there is a low barrier to entry and is it open to anyone. While it is open to everyone, there is quite a bit of disc consumption required. This <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cost-full-bitcoin-node/">Bitcoin.com link</a> from Feb 2017, indicated that one user calculated their cost to be approximately $20.00/month to run a node using AWS. Since I have never run a full Bitcoin node, I can neither confirm or deny this statement. Another reason it is decentralized in that anyone can mine bitcoin theoretically. However, if you don&#8217;t have special hardware and are not part of a mining pool, there is a low probability of success. Lastly was the point regarding updates to the software. This task falls on the core developers who are trusted and supported by the bitcoin community.</p>
